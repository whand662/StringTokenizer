# String Tokenizer

Remember to compile using c++11!

Takes a string, and breaks it into a vector of strings based on a set of delimiters. The delimiters in the string are not included in the output.

For example, using only space as a delimiter:
"Hello World"

Will give you a vector of two strings:
"Hello" and "World"
(note that the space was removed)

See Documentation.html for more information.
